Version: 1.b (I suppose)

* Variable region and sub-region shapes completed.
* Loading and saving of chunks and regions works.
* Colours for each have been implemented.
* Created a 'frontier' region that matches the region boundaries to cover all the non-main areas.
    I could also just maybe add in more sub-regions or make the existing larger, but this feels more 'explorationy'.
        -> Sadly, the rendering issue would still remain. Too many chunks being loaded is slowing everything down when
           the map is open. Next big issue.


==== Next Steps ====
* Variable renders depending on the zoom and distance from the player.
    -> Hopefully will reduce the performance lag, only rendering chunks around player.

Min zoom: Faint outline and shading of discovered kingdoms, regular rendering of undiscovered boundaries.
Med zoom levels: Subregions visible, fainter if discovered, regular if not
Max zoom: If undiscovered, only subregions. If discovered, the chunks as usual.

* Area in and around viewport are rendered, otherwise not.
* If looking at kingdom other than current, only show if zoomed in.
	-> Use distance based calculations maybe, there's something in the api for that.
* For current kingdom, show the chunks and other layers as usual.

Background:
Always have the kingdom boundaries loaded.
Load subregion on demand.
Load chunks only for visible and current areas.
